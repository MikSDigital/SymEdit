  Add group roles for each group. 

    - During the set in array access, check the group config for the
      required role as well as in the form element. 

      If not, throw error. In form, just omit it. 

  Form constraints. Put this in the setting config, not in the form. It will be loaded anyway
  and this will allow for differences in XML vs Yaml vs whatever else is used.
