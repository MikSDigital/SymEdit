   What you were working on...

     We should have a toggle when you create a user to decide whether or not it should be an admin.
     Once that form is completed, we can render different forms based on the type of user it is. 

     Doing it like this will prevent us from having to demote a user and change their profile type
     or vice versa. It should be easy to go back and forth, but we can't have users without
     admin profiles in the admin or it will cause errors. 

     Likewise with super admin.. If you're going to become a Super Admin, you already need to be an 
     admin. That option shouldn't be available to add to a user's roles. 

     Maybe we can have an extra field in the roles table to see whether or not it's an admin
     role or a user role? That way we never allow a regular user to even be given a role they shouldn't
     be using??
